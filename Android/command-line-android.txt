Building an Android App
from the Command Line
(4 January 2017)

   I have been learning a bit of Android programming recently (late to the party, I know). One thing that
   frustrated me was figuring out how to actually build an Android program.

   Things are simple enough with C. As explained in the first section of K&R, one might write this as a
   first program:
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
        printf("Hello, world!\n");
        return 0;
}

   and turn it into an executable by simply invoking the system compiler as below.
$ cc hello.c
$ ./a.out
Hello, world!

   This diagram illustrates the full process:

   LaTeX

   For Android, however, the official way to write Hello World is to fire up Android Studio, use its wizard
   to create a new project, and the application will then be generated and built automagically in a few
   minutes.

   This is of course intended as a convenience for the developer, but for someone who wants to know what's
   going on, it makes things difficult instead. What actually happened? Which of all these files are really
   necessary for Hello World?

   Others have expressed similar concerns:

   John Carmack: Create and run an empty activity in Android Studio and I get a 38 MB folder with 1,175
   files. We've just given up on elegance.

   (For me, it generated a 50 MB directory containing 1,348 files spread across 630 subdirectories.)

   Perhaps it is the control freak in me speaking (a good trait for programmers about their programs), but I
   simply don't feel comfortable not understanding how to build my own program.

   Below are my notes on how to build an Android application by hand from the command line. The instructions
   are for Linux, but they should be easy to adapt to Mac or Windows. The full source code and a build
   script is available in command_line_android.tar.gz.

Installing the Development Tools

   Android applications are usually written in Java, so building them requires having a Java Development Kit
   (JDK) installed. The current version of the Android tools require Java 8, which I downloaded from here,
   extracted and put on my PATH like so:
$ tar zxf jdk-8u112-linux-x64.tar.gz
$ export JAVA_HOME=${HOME}/jdk1.8.0_112
$ export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH

   Android specific tools are provided in the Android Software Development Kit (SDK). Normally, this is
   installed when installing Android Studio, but we can also do it ourselves (see the "Get just the command
   line tools" section on the Android Studio download page):
$ curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r24.4.1-linux.tgz
$ tar zxf android-sdk_r24.4.1-linux.tgz

   Unfortunately, that file doesn't contain everything we need, as explained in SDK Readme.txt:
The Android SDK archive initially contains only the basic SDK tools. It does
not contain an Android platform or any third-party libraries. In fact, it
doesn't even have all the tools you need to develop an application.

In order to start developing applications, you must install the Platform-tools
and at least one version of the Android platform, using the SDK Manager.

   What we need is build-tools (for aapt, dx and apksigner), an Android Platform to target (I will use
   version 16) and platform-tools (for adb).

   Instead of using the SDK Manager as suggested above, we can install those directly ourselves (the
   filenames were found in repository-11.xml):
$ curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/build-tools_r25-linux.zip
$ unzip build-tools_r25-linux.zip
$ mkdir android-sdk-linux/build-tools
$ mv android-7.1.1 android-sdk-linux/build-tools/25.0.0

$ curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-16_r05.zip
$ unzip android-16_r05.zip
$ mv android-4.1.2 android-sdk-linux/platforms/android-16

$ curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r25-linux.zip
$ unzip platform-tools_r25-linux.zip -d android-sdk-linux/

The Hello World Program

   Our Hello World program consists of three files: an application manifest, a layout and an Activity.

   The app manifest is shown below (AndroidManifest.xml). It specifies the name of the app, which Android
   API it targets, etc. The intent-filter element sets up MainActivity as the main entry point of the
   program.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          package="net.hanshq.hello"
          versionCode="1"
          versionName="0.1">
    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="16"/>
    <application android:label="Hello">
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>

   Below is the layout file (res/layout/activity_main.xml). It defines UI elements to be used in our
   program.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:gravity="center"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:id="@+id/my_text"/>
</LinearLayout>

   Finally, the Activity is implemented like this: (java/net/hanshq/hello/MainActivity.java)
package net.hanshq.hello;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        TextView text = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.my_text);
        text.setText("Hello, world!");
    }
}

Building

   We will use shell variables to more conveniently refer to the SDK we installed before. All build
   artifacts will be put in subdirectories of the build directory which we create here.
$ SDK="${HOME}/android-sdk-linux"
$ BUILD_TOOLS="${SDK}/build-tools/25.0.0"
$ PLATFORM="${SDK}/platforms/android-16"
$ mkdir -p build/gen build/obj build/apk

   The first build step is to generate the R.java file, which is used for referring to resources (such as
   R.id.my_text above). This is done using the Android Asset Packaging Tool, aapt:
$ "${BUILD_TOOLS}/aapt" package -f -m -J build/gen/ -S res \
      -M AndroidManifest.xml -I "${PLATFORM}/android.jar"

   which creates build/gen/net/hanshq/hello/R.java.

   The -f flag causes aapt to overwrite any existing output file, -m causes it to create package directories
   under the output directory, and -J makes it generate the R.java file and sets the output directory. -S
   points out the resource directory, -M specifies the manifest, and -I adds the platform .jar as an
   "include file".

   Now that all the Java code is ready, we can compile it using javac:
$ javac -source 1.7 -target 1.7 -bootclasspath "${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar" \
      -classpath "${PLATFORM}/android.jar" -d build/obj \
      build/gen/net/hanshq/hello/R.java java/net/hanshq/hello/MainActivity.java

   (The 1.7 and -bootclasspath ure used to emit Java 7 byte code, which the Android tools expect, despite
   using JDK version 8.)

   The Java compiler created .class files containing byte code for the Java Virtual Machine. That then has
   to be translated to Dalvik byte code using the dx tool:
$ "${BUILD_TOOLS}/dx" --dex --output=build/apk/classes.dex build/obj/

   (There is a new set of Android tools, Jack and Jill, that compile Java code directly into Dalvik
   bytecode. Maybe that will become the way to do things in the future.)

   We then package the contents of the build/apk/ directory together with the manifest and resources into an
   Android Application Package (APK) file, again using the aapt tool:
$ "${BUILD_TOOLS}/aapt" package -f -M AndroidManifest.xml -S res/ \
      -I "${PLATFORM}/android.jar" \
      -F build/Hello.unsigned.apk build/apk/

   The application has now been built, but the APK file needs to be signed before any device will allow
   running it, even in debug mode, and zipaligned if we ever want to publish it in the Play Store.

   First, we run the zipalign tool, which aligns uncompressed files in the APK on 4-byte boundaries for
   easier memory mapping:
$ "${BUILD_TOOLS}/zipalign" -f -p 4 \
      build/Hello.unsigned.apk build/Hello.aligned.apk

   Then we use the Java keytool to create a key store and key for signing:
$ keytool -genkeypair -keystore keystore.jks -alias androidkey \
      -validity 10000 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
      -storepass android -keypass android
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:
Is CN=Unknown, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?
  [no]:  yes

   (you may want to put in more proper values of course.)

   and use that key to sign our application with apksigner:
$ "${BUILD_TOOLS}/apksigner" sign --ks keystore.jks \
      --ks-key-alias androidkey --ks-pass pass:android \
      --key-pass pass:android --out build/Hello.apk \
      build/Hello.aligned.apk

   Et voilà, we have successfully built an Android application by hand from the command line! The diagram
   below illustrates the whole process.

   (We skipped some common steps that aren't strictly necessary: linting and ProGuard.)

Running

   We can install our freshly built APK on a device (which must have USB debugging enabled) using the
   Android Debug Bridge:
$ "${SDK}/platform-tools/adb" install -r build/Hello.apk

   and run it, either by starting it manually from the Launcher, or with adb:
$ "${SDK}/platform-tools/adb" shell am start -n net.hanshq.hello/.MainActivity

Using Native Code

   While Android applications are usually written in Java, they can also contain native code, that is,
   machine code to be run directly by the device's processor. This is useful for performance, as it removes
   the overhead from running Java code, and for portability, as it opens the platform to code written in
   other languages.

   Adding native code to our program makes it a little harder to build, but it turns out not to be too bad.

   The Android Native Development Kit (NDK) provides compilers and libraries for building C and C++ code for
   Android. It can be installed like this:
$ curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r13b-linux-x86_64.zip
$ unzip android-ndk-r13b-linux-x86_64.zip
$ NDK="${HOME}/android-ndk-r13b"

   We set more shell variables to point at the specific toolchains we'll use: (if you're not using Linux,
   you'll want one of the other prebuilt directories)
$ ARM_TOOLCHAIN="${NDK}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/"
$ ARM_TOOLCHAIN+="linux-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc"

$ X86_TOOLCHAIN="${NDK}/toolchains/x86-4.9/prebuilt/"
$ X86_TOOLCHAIN+="linux-x86_64/bin/i686-linux-android-gcc"

   We will update our Activity to use the Java Native Interface (see also Android JNI Tips) for a new
   method, getMessage(), and use that method to set the text of the TextView. The native method will be
   implemented by a library called hello, which we load with System.loadLibrary in a static initializer
   block:
package net.hanshq.hello;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("hello");
    }

    public native String getMessage();

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        TextView text = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.my_text);
        text.setText(getMessage());
    }
}

   The hello library must provide a native implementation of the getMessage method. To figure out what C
   function signature corresponds to the Java method, we use the javah tool:
$ javah -classpath "${PLATFORM}/android.jar:build/obj" \
      -o /tmp/jni.h net.hanshq.hello.MainActivity
$ grep -A1 _getMessage /tmp/jni.h
JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL Java_net_hanshq_hello_MainActivity_getMessage
  (JNIEnv *, jobject);

   We implement it like this, in hello.c:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <jni.h>

static const char *const messages[] = {
        "Hello, world!",
        "Hej världen!",
        "Bonjour, monde!",
        "Hallo Welt!"
};

JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
Java_net_hanshq_hello_MainActivity_getMessage(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj)
{
        int i;

        i = rand() % (sizeof(messages) / sizeof(messages[0]));

        return (*env)->NewStringUTF(env, messages[i]);
}

   The C file is compiled into the shared library libhello.so (note the extra lib prefix). We build one for
   ARMv7 and one for X86, to support most devices and emulators, and put them under the APK's lib/
   directory:
$ mkdir -p build/apk/lib/armeabi-v7a build/apk/lib/x86

$ "${ARM_TOOLCHAIN}" --sysroot="${NDK}/platforms/android-16/arch-arm" \
      -march=armv7-a -mfpu=vfpv3-d16 -mfloat-abi=softfp -Wl,--fix-cortex-a8 \
      -fPIC -shared -o build/apk/lib/armeabi-v7a/libhello.so jni/hello.c

$ "${X86_TOOLCHAIN}" --sysroot="${NDK}/platforms/android-16/arch-x86" \
      -fPIC -shared -o build/apk/lib/x86/libhello.so jni/hello.c

   (See the ABI Management doc for which ABIs can be targeted with the NDK, and under which lib/ directory
   to put the .so file. The ARM compiler flags were inspired by
   ${NDK}/build/core/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/setup.mk.)

   To build the APK, we repeat the build steps from above (aapt all the way to apksigner). The contents of
   the APK can be inspected with the jar tool:
$ jar tf build/Hello.apk
AndroidManifest.xml
classes.dex
lib/armeabi-v7a/libhello.so
lib/x86/libhello.so
res/layout/activity_main.xml
resources.arsc
META-INF/ANDROIDK.SF
META-INF/ANDROIDK.RSA
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

   The file should contain the manifest, the Java classes converted to DEX format, our two native .so files,
   Application resources in raw (activity_main.xml) and binary (resources.arsc) form. The META-INF directory
   contains the JAR file manifest and cryptographic signatures.

   When run, the application looks like this:
